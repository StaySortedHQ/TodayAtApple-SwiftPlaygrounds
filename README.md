# Today at Apple

## Create iconic interactions using SwiftUI on Swift Playgrounds

The developers behind SortedÂ³ were invited to teach a coding session at Apple's Today at Apple event. After some discussions with the team from Apple, we designed to teach about the lastest programming technology, SwiftUI, which Apple announced in WWDC19.

The session includes introductions to SwiftUI and Swift Playgrounds. Participants will learn to build an iconic user interaction that powers a number of apps these days.
