 # Step 4: Include data model
 
 * callout(Task):
 Goal: Create more cards with a list of food names and images
 
 Now, having just one or two food choices are not fun. Let's add more food.
 
 * callout(Task):
 You'll create an array of food choices and show them with a for-loop.
 
 Instead of copying the `CardView` for many times, we can display a list of food choices using a for-loop.
 
 ## Congratulations
 
 You've finished this tutorial. Now you're capable to start your app development journey.
