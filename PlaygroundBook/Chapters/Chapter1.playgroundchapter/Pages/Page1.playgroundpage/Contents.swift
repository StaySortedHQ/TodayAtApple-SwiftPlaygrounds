 # Step 1: Start with the basics
 
 * callout(Task):
 Goal: Learn how to write code.
 
 To start, we're going to learn a little bit of syntax of Swift.
 
 * callout(Tip):
 If you get stuck, don't worry. The Apple team and Sorted team are here to help.
 
 First, you'll apply some changes to the existing text.
 
 * callout(Task):
 You'll create a title and a rectangle.
 
 Then, we can add a rectangle above the text.
 
 When you've successfully got a **basic layout**, you can go to the **[next page](@next)**.
